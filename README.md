Intro:

This is a Splatoon 1 competitive level tier list. Really, it's more of an excercise in how to make a community tier list. The idea is to make a tier list by reaching a consensus through discussion rather than taking a vote. If you'd like to join the discussion, find us at http://tinyurl.com/inkademy.

-------------------------------------------

Rules:

Discussion on the tier list is moderated. Discussion participants may nominate changes to the list. The moderator will then pick a number of nominations to discuss for a few days. Participants then debate the proposed changes. At the end of the debating period, the moderator will determine if a consensus has been reached on each of the changes and update the list accordingly. After that, a new batch of nominations can be submitted. The idea is to discuss a weapon, reach a consensus on it (if possible), and then move on.

The tier list moderator has the authority to judge the quality of discussion about a proposed change. The tier list is meant to reflect the opinions of all discussion participants, not just the moderator. However, the moderator is allowed to consider the quality of arguments when deciding whether to make a change to the tier list. The moderator may extend discussion on a proposed change and ask for more detail about a specific argument. If the moderator finds an argument to be poor, he should help the participants improve it.

For the first week, there will be unlimited nominations for changes in order to get any obvious changes out of the way.

Remember that this tier list is just for fun and is reflective of popular opinion instead of anyone's vision of what is "correct".

-------------------------------------------

The List:

Tier definitions are generally based on how many scenarios is the weapon in question good for. A "scenario" can be a map, a mode, a team composition, a strategy, or a set of circumstances that can happen within a game. Weapons that are a good choice or the best choice for a large number of scenarios belong higher in the tier list.

A consequence of these tier definitions is that weapons in the B and C tiers can still find a place on top teams. They are simply less common because they come with significant limitations compared to those in A tier.

Instead of an ordered ranking, each tier has + and - sections which reflect small differences within each tier. Some sections are missing due to the original tier list missing some. Feel free to propose changes involving + and - sections that don't exist yet.

-------------------------------------------

S Tier = Overpowered

Weapons in the S tier are the best choice for every or almost every scenario. They may be so powerful at one particular aspect of the game that they become necessary to use. Or they may have so few weaknesses that running 2, 3, or even 4 of the same weapon in a team composition is not only viable but a powerful strategy in a large number of scenarios. 

S:
- Nothing for now. We may not add anything to this tier. 

-------------------------------------------

A Tier = Reliable

Weapons in the A tier are strong in a large number of scenarios without major weaknesses. They can be used effectively on almost if not all maps and modes. What weaknesses they have can be overcome with basic team composition. When put on a team composition, these weapons provide more support to their teammates than they require from them.

A+:
- Custom Range Blaster
- Tentatek Splattershot
- Zink Mini Splatling

A:
- Bento Splat Charger + Scope
- Dynamo Roller

A-:
- .96 Gal Deco
- Berry Splattershot Pro
- Custom Hydra Splatling

-------------------------------------------

B Tier = Flawed

Weapons in the B tier may have similar strengths to those in A tier but have some flaw that keeps them from doing everything weapons in the A tier can do. They may be weak on certain maps or they may have fewer options to draw on in response to common game scenarios. Putting one of these weapons on a team composition will mean that other teammates have to cover this weapon's weakness.

B+:
- .52 Gal
- Carbon Roller
- Cherry H-3 Nozzlenose
- Custom E-Liter 3K + Scope
- E-Liter 3K + Scope
- Gold Dynamo Roller
- Luna Blaster Neo
- Rapid Blaster

B:
- Custom Jet Squelcher
- Fresh Squiffer
- Grim Range Blaster
- Heavy Splatling Deco
- Heavy Splatling Remix
- Kelp Splat Charger + Scope

B-:
- Custom Blaster

- Neo Splash-o-Matic

- Splattershot Pro

-------------------------------------------

C Tier = Niche

Weapons in the C tier are suboptimal choices for most scenarios, but they have a niche that allows them to be used on certain maps or team compositions. Using a weapon in the C tier will often require a strategy built around incorporating the weapon in order to function optimally. 

C+:
- Blaster
- Classic Squiffer
- Heavy Splatling
- Krak-on Splat Roller
- Mini Splatling
- N-ZAP '83
- Splattershot

C:
- .96 Gal
- H-3 Nozzlenose
- L-3 Nozzlenose

Weapons in the D tier are suboptimal for every scenario. What makes them different from those in the C tier is that any unique advantages they bring amount to unreliable gimmicks.
